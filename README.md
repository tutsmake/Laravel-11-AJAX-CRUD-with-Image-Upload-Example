# Laravel 11 Ajax CRUD Image Upload Example Tutorial

In Laravel 11, implementing an AJAX CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with image upload functionality can greatly enhance user experience. By leveraging AJAX, users can interact with the application without the need for page refreshes, providing a seamless and efficient workflow.

To create such an application, you would start by setting up your Laravel project and defining routes for the CRUD operations. You would then create a controller to handle these operations, ensuring that image uploads are handled correctly. In your views, you would use JavaScript to send AJAX requests to the server and update the DOM dynamically based on the responses.

To use a Laravel 11 AJAX CRUD project with image upload functionality, follow these steps:

<h1> Step 1: Clone the Repository</h1>

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the git clone command. For example:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/tutsmake/Laravel-11-AJAX-CRUD-with-Image-Upload-Example.git</pre>

<h1> Step 2: Navigate to the Project</h1>

Go to the project directory:

<pre>cd Laravel-11-AJAX-CRUD-with-Image-Upload-Example</pre>

<h1> Step 3: Install Dependencies </h1>

Install the project dependencies using Composer:

<pre>composer install</pre>

<h1> Step 4: Create Environment File</h1>

Create a .env file by copying the .env.example file:

<pre>cp .env.example .env</pre>

<h1> Step 5: Generate Application Key</h1>

Generate the application key:

<pre>php artisan key:generate</pre>

<h1> Step 6: Configure Database</h1>

Set your database connection details in the .env file.

<h1>Step 7: Run Migrations</h1>

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

<pre>php artisan migrate</pre>

<h1>Step 8: Start the Development Server</h1>

Start the Laravel development server:

<pre>php artisan serve</pre>

Access the Application: Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

Test the Application: Test the CRUD and image upload functionality by adding, editing, and deleting tasks with images.
